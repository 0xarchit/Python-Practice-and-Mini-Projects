1. Class and Object Basics
Define a Class and an Object in OOP with suitable examples. Explain how a class acts as a
blueprint for creating objects.
Instructions: Provide at least one real-life example to explain the concept clearly.

Certainly, let's break down the concepts of Class and Object in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

**1. Class**

* **Definition:** A class is like a blueprint or a template that defines a set of properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that objects of that class will possess. It's a general description of a category of things.

* **Example:** Let's consider a "Car" class. 

    * **Attributes:** 
        * Color (e.g., "red", "blue")
        * Model (e.g., "Sedan", "SUV")
        * Speed (e.g., 0 km/h)
        * Fuel Level (e.g., 50 liters)
    * **Methods:** 
        * `start()` 
        * `accelerate()` 
        * `brake()` 
        * `refuel()`

**2. Object**

* **Definition:** An object is an instance of a class. It represents a specific entity that has the characteristics defined by the class. 

* **Example:** 

    * "MyCar" could be an object of the "Car" class. 
        * "MyCar" might have specific attributes like: 
            * Color: "Red" 
            * Model: "Sedan"
            * Speed: 0 km/h
            * Fuel Level: 50 liters

**How Class Acts as a Blueprint**

* The "Car" class provides a general structure for any car. It defines the properties and behaviors that all cars should have.
* When you create an object like "MyCar", you're essentially creating a specific car with its own unique set of values for the properties defined in the "Car" class.

**Real-Life Example**

* Imagine you're building houses. 
    * The "House" class would be the architectural plan. It defines the number of rooms, bathrooms, kitchen size, etc. 
    * Each individual house built using that plan would be an "object" of the "House" class. Each house would have its own unique features like color, size of the garden, and specific furniture arrangements, while still adhering to the general structure defined by the plan.

**In Summary**

* A class is a general concept, while an object is a specific instance of that concept.
* The class defines the template, and the object is the actual thing created based on that template.

I hope this explanation is helpful! Let me know if you have any further questions.
